    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Al is almost never wrong. Although, when he is, a domain gets bought and blog started in his honor. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; you may ask. For that you must know a bit more about Al.</p>

<p>Al is exhubrant, bright, passionate, and, most importantly, the biggest shit talker I know. You see, I work with Al. Right next to Al and, because of this close proximity, I get more than my fair share of shit talking. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I enjoy every minute of it but I have a responsibility to give it back and this blog is one of many ways. Its a New Day!</p>
