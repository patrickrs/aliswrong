Al is almost never wrong. Although, when he is, a domain gets bought and blog started in his honor. "Why?" you may ask. For that you must know a bit more about Al.

Al is exhubrant, bright, passionate, and, most importantly, the biggest shit talker I know. You see, I work with Al. Right next to Al and, because of this close proximity, I get more than my fair share of shit talking. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy every minute of it but I have a responsibility to give it back and this blog is one of many ways. Its a New Day!
